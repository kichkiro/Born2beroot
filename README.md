	<p>
		This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization. <br>
		You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you can‚Äôt use VirtualBox) under specific instructions. <br>
		Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up your own operating system while implementing strict rules.

## üìå - Key Topics

### Virtualization
  Virtualization refers to the creation of virtual instances of physical hardware, allowing for the efficient deployment and management of multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. 
  
  This process includes the use of hypervisors, virtual machines (VMs), and containerization technologies to enhance resource allocation, isolation, and scalability. 
  
  The topic covers the principles of designing, configuring, and maintaining virtual environments to support various applications and workloads.

### Linux System Administration
  This topic encompasses the management and configuration of Linux-based operating systems, including the installation of essential services, user management, system security, and performance monitoring. 
  
  It involves the application of best practices for maintaining system integrity, optimizing resource utilization, and implementing effective security measures such as firewalls and access control policies.
